    "# Custom Model\n",
    "This guide will step through the process of implementing a custom model that can be used in NeuRec. It will show example code snippets that can help build a custom model, however, further development is needed to successfully complete the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of implementing a custom model involves two main steps: creating a model class; and, adding the model to NeuRec. The following sections discusses these two steps in detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating a Model Class\n",
    "This step involves creating a class in the **model** folder. This class must extend the **AbstractRecommender** class, also in the model folder, and implement the required functions, namely:\n",
    "\n",
    "* \\_\\_init\\_\\_()\n",
    "* build_graph()\n",
    "* train_model()\n",
    "* predict()\n",
    "\n",
    "> The class may have additional functions on top of these required functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of a shell custom model is shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from neurec.model.AbstractRecommender import AbstractRecommender\n",
    "\n",
    "class Custom(AbstractRecommender):\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        none\n",
    "        \n",
    "    def build_graph(self):\n",
    "        none\n",
    "        \n",
    "    def train_model(self):\n",
    "        none\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def predict(self):\n",
    "        none\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The following sections will discuss each of the function in turn, starting with creating configuration settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Configuration\n",
    "You may want some configuration settings for your custom model. This can be achieved by creating a file in the **conf** folder, for example Custom.properties. The contents of this file may look like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[hyperparameters]\n",
    "epochs=100\n",
    "batch_size=256\n",

    "loss_function=cross_entropy\n",
    "verbose=1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### \\_\\_init\\_\\_()\n",
    "This function can be used to initialise any settings that are required by the model. This includes any configuration settings, discussed above, which can be read into the model like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from neurec.evaluation import Evaluate\n",
    "from neurec.model.AbstractRecommender import AbstractRecommender\n",

    "This function is called by NeuRec to train the model. You can use the data_gen module to generate the necessary data for training, which can be found in the **util** folder.
